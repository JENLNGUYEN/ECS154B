================================

Important Information
---------------------

### Time and Location

*Office Hours*: 4:00 PM - 6:00PM Wednesday, or by appointment.

*Office Location*: 3049 Kemper Hall

Please suggest a meeting time when you email me for an appointment.
You can use [my calendar](http://goo.gl/hmtAH) to quickly find a time I am available.
It's not guaranteed to be completely up-to-date, but it gives a good starting point.

### Teaching Assistants

**TBA** (@ucdavis.edu)

*Office Hours*: TBA

*Office Location*: TBA

### GitHub

We will use [GitHub](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B) as the main website and entry point for all course information.
The version of documents found on GitHub are the canonical versions of all documents.
Other downloaded versions of documents may become out of date.
If I make changes to those documents, they will appear first on GitHub.

GitHub will contain this document and the assignments.

### Canvas

We will be using [Canvas](https://canvas.ucdavis.edu/) for grade distribution.

### Gradescope

We will use [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com/courses/) for all assignments including lab submissions and returning quizzes, the midterm, and the final.
Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account.

All lab assignments will be autograded by Gradescope.
When you upload your code to Gradescope, a set of tests will be run on it and your grade *will be immediately available*.
You may submit your code any number of times.
Only the final submission will be accepted as the grade for your assignment.
However, if you submit after the deadline, the [late policy](#Late-Assignments) applies.

### Piazza

We will use [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/) for class discussions outside of the classroom.
If you haven't used Piazza before, it's a cool tool that is essentially a message board for the class.
Both the TAs and I will be on Piazza to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on Piazza. That way, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing the TAs or me.
Additionally, you might get a much faster response from one of your classmates!
Through asking and answering questions on Piazza, you improve your understanding of the material, and improve other students' understanding as well.

In the spirit of the above, please ask questions as public questions on Piazza, if possible.
This way, your question, and the answer to your question, can help somebody else who might have the same question.
We will change questions asked privately to public, if we deem it appropriate.
If your question involves code you've written, or is about a personal issue, we will leave those private.

10% of your grade is tied to participation, much of which will take place over Piazza.
The benchmark for good Piazza participation is at least 10 questions asked, answered, or follow-ups throughout the quarter.

### Regrade Requests

Regrade requests must be made within one week of the return of the assignment or test.
Regrade requests should be made in person in office hours or by appointment.

### Accommodations

The exam schedule is available on the [schedule](). Per [official UC Davis policy](http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/academicinfo/exams.html), if you have an accommodation request from the [Student Disability Center](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/), or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me **by the fourth class, January 14, 2018**.

Academic Misconduct
-------------------

Academic misconduct is a serious issue. You can find the official UC Davis policy on the [Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](http://sja.ucdavis.edu/) website.

You are expected to *cite all of the work you reference*. Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known (e.g., caches hold data) should have a citation. When in doubt, cite.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
This can result in a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class.

Prerequisites
-------------

ECS 154A; or both EEC 170 and EEC 180A.

PTAs
----

Before asking for a PTA, be sure that you have read the [Computer Science Department's PTA Policy](http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/blog/pta-policy/).
PTA numbers will only be issued after the 12th day of instruction, and PTA numbers are only issued for extenuating circumstances related to graduation.

Assignments and Tests
---------------------

### Grading Breakdown

TODO: fix the below

|Category     |Percentage|
|-------------|---|
|Participation|10%|
|Labs (5x)    |40%|
|Quizzes (3x) |15%|
|Midterm      |15%|
|Final        |20%|

### Participation

10% of your grade comes from actively participating in class (defined broadly).
You are expected to participate on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/) (e.g., at least 10 contributions), lecture discussions, discussion section discussions, **or** office hours.

### Labs

You will complete five lab assignments throughout this course.
The labs can be found via the links below.
All together, the labs are worth 40% of your final grade.
Each lab is weighted based on the amount of time you are given to complete the lab.

Labs are due at 12 AM (midnight) on Sunday night / Monday morning.

TODO: Dates

-   [Lab 1](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B/blob/master/lab1/lab1.rst) (1 week, 4%). Due January .
-   [Lab 2](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B/blob/master/lab2/lab2.rst) (2 weeks, 8%). Due February .
-   [Lab 3](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B/blob/master/lab3/lab3.rst) (3 weeks, 12%). Due February .
-   [Lab 4](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B/blob/master/lab4/lab4.rst) (2 weeks, 8%). Due March .
-   [Lab 5](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B/blob/master/lab5/lab5.rst) (2 week, 8%). Due March .

#### Late Assignments

If you turn in a lab late, you will lose points.
The percentage of points you will lose is given by the equation below.
This will give you partial points up to 72 hours after the due date and penalizes you less if you barely miss the deadline.

![image](late_policy.png){width="50%"}

Note: When submitting late the reduction in points will not immediately appear in Gradescope.
Rest assured, we will go through and double check all of the submission times ;).

### Quizzes

There will be quizzes during some discussion sections.
The quizzes will be in a similar style to the midterm and the final, except they will be shorter (25 minutes).

### Midterm: February

<TODO: The midterm will cover something...>

You are allowed **one** 8.5x11 sheet of *handwritten* notes.

### Final: Tuesday, March 20, 2018 at 1 AM

<TODO: The final will cover something, or it will be cumulative.>

You are allowed **one** 8.5x11 sheet of *handwritten* notes.

Reading List and Schedule
-------------------------

### Textbook

In this class, we'll be closely following *Computer Organization and Design RISC-V Edition: The Hardware/Software Interface* by D. A. Patterson and J. L. Hennessy.

Importantly, you should get the *RISC-V edition*, not the ARM edition and not the MIPS edition. This is different from versions in years past.
The correct version is white with a picture of an abacus on a tablet.

Additionally, you may find *The RISC-V Reader: An Open Architecture Atlas* a useful companion, but this book is not required.
We will be implementing a RISC-V processor in this class and having a physical book with the RISC-V instructions described will be useful.
If you prefer to not buy yet another book (though I do think it's a useful book to have), you can also use the online version of [the RISC-V specification](https://riscv.org/specifications/).
Note: the specification has fewer pretty pictures than the book.

You can find these books at the [university bookstore](http://ucdavisstores.com/SelectTermDept) or through various sites online.
