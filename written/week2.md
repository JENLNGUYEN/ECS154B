## Topics covered

* Instruction set architectures (ISAs)
  * RISC versus CISC
* RISC-V
  * Instruction types
  * Extensions
* From code to execution
  * Going from higher-level languages to machine code
  * Executing an instruction
* Single-cycle CPU
  * Datapath
  * Adding new instructions

## Problems

### Instruction set architectures

1. What is an instruction set architecture? (Hint: think about software and hardware.)
2. Name three things that are part of an ISA. Is the frequency of the CPU part of the ISA?
3. What is the Iron Law? (This will be covered later in class, but it was also mentioned in the 2017 Turing Lecture.)
4. RISC quickly overtook CISC as the ISA style of choice due to its performance. As mentioned in the 2017 Turing Lecture (14:15), the VAX had an average CPI of 10. How would a RISC architecture be faster than the VAX? Use your answer from the previous problem to show this.

### RISC-V

5. Is RISC-V an implementation of hardware? What about x86 or ARM?

### From code to execution

Under construction.

### Single-cycle CPU

Under construction.
