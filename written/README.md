# Written problem sets

Written problems for each week will be uploaded after the week is over.
These problems aren't mandatory, so your answers won't be collected.
That being said, these problems will be very similar in style to the questions on the midterms and final.
It's in your best interest to do them at some point.

## Solutions

Solutions won't be posted on GitHub.
If you'd like answers to the problems, either post on Piazza or go to Jason's or Justin's office hours.
