## Problems

1. What is the Iron Law?
2. RISC quickly overtook CISC as the ISA style of choice due to its performance. As mentioned in the 2017 Turing Lecture (14:15), the VAX had an average CPI of 10. How would a RISC architecture be faster than the VAX? Use your answer from the previous problem to show this.
3. What is Dennard scaling? How does it differ from Moore's law?
4. In a CMOS device, what is power equal to?
5. Use your answer from the previous problem to help answer this question. Assume we want to improve performance of a CMOS device. In what two ways can we improve its performance, using the same number of transistors? How can we accomplish this?
6. What has become a problem as we've lowered the CMOS device voltage further and further? Why is this an issue?
7. As predicted by Moore's law, we were able to pack increasingly larger amounts of transistors onto a single chip. However, we've come across the "dark silicon" problem, where large portions of the transistors on a chip are left turned off, or "dark," at a time. Why are they left turned off? What would happen if we tried to power them all at the same time?
